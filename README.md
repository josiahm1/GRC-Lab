# GRC-Lab

## Objective

This GRC Lab is aimed to conduct a structured cybersecurity self-assessment of Old Dominion Univeristy (ODU) using the National Cybersecurity Review (NCRS) version 1.1 framework. This project involved mapping 108 NCSR assessment questions to their respectice subcategories and applying the NCSR maturity scoring scale (Levels 1-7) to determine ODU's relative capability in each control area. Ultimately, the goal was the produce a realisitc, evidence-based maturity snapshot that could support strategic cybersecurity planning, enhance risk management practices and align instiutional security efforts with nationally recognized best practices for higher education environments.

### Skills Learned

- Evaulated and scored ODU IT security policies through extensive open-source research, policy review and control mapping.
- Performed a formal risk assessment to identify control gaps, maturity weaknesses and potential areas of cyber exposure.
- Drafted a professional executive summary communication key findings, strengths and improvment opportunities for leadership stakeholders.
- Analyzed instituional cybersecurity posture against higher-education threat landscapes and best practices.
- Strengthened skills in GRC methodologies, risk analysis and cybersecurity maturity modeling.
- Demonstrated attention to detail, documentation discipline and ability to translate technical risk into business-relevant insights.
